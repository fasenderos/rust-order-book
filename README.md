# Rust Order Book

<p align="center">
Ultra-fast Rust Order Book </br> for high-frequency trading (HFT) :rocket::rocket: </br></br>
:star: Star me on GitHub ‚Äî it motivates me a lot!
</p>

> This crate is a Rust port of one of my Node.js projects, the [nodejs-order-book](https://github.com/fasenderos/nodejs-order-book). I built it while learning Rust, so it works, but don't be surprised if it's not 100% idiomatic‚Äîor if some features, like conditional orders, haven't been ported yet. They will be added over time.
